# Getting Started with Create React App

# Final Project

## Frontend movie database

    This project was created with React. I used the TMDb database API to create a simplistic movie info database.

    I've implemented a horizontal carousel type menu that can be clicked through via left or right arrow buttons, or scroll/ dragged through.

    The search function accesses the whole database so you can look up any movie. Clicking on any movie post will open the detailed about window.

There are many different ways I have organized the content. On the
more info popup, each movie has 5 similar or related movies. Which can
lead you to discovering something you've never heard of.

List of technologies include: React.js, React Router, TMDb API, react-simple-star-rating, framer-motion, CSS and Responsive Design. I addressed most challanges using state and effect hooks. The site is fully responsive with extensive breakpoints for most devices. The page effortlessly resizes with smooth transitions. I extended the top rated collection by creating a page selection option. There are now 10 pages worth of top rated movies. I chose to go in my own direction with the UI.
