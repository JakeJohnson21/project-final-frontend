# Getting Started with Create React App

# Final Project

## Frontend movie database

    This project was created with React. I used the TMDb database API to

create a simplistic movie info database.

    I've implemented a horizontal carousel type menu that can be clicked

through via left or right arrow buttons, or scroll/ dragged through.

    The search function accesses the whole database so you can look up any

movie. Clicking on any movie post will open the detailed about window.
There are many different ways I have organized the content. On the
more info popup, each movie has 5 similar or related movies. Which can
lead you to discovering something you've never heard of.

List of technologies used include: React, NPM, CSS, JSX, REST API, Responsive Design

    I addressed most challanges with state and effect hooks. The site is

fully responsive with extensive breakpoints for many different
devices. The page effortlessly resizes with smooth transitions.

    I extended the top rated collection by creating a page selection

option. There are now 10 pages worth of top rated movies. I chose to
go in my own direction with the UI.
