# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was created with React and has great capabilities. I used the OMDb database API to create a fresh take on a movie database. The site is much simpler but I've found it to be beautiful and fun to use. During the time I spent building it, new, or updated movies would pop up and it has been interesting.

I addressed most challanges with state and effect hooks. The site is fully responsive with extensive breakpoints for many different devices. The page effortlessly resizes with snappy transitions over the majority of elements.

I've implemented a horizontal menu that can be clicked through via left or right arrow buttons, or scroll/ dragged through.

The search function accesses the whole database so you can look up any movie. Clicking on any movie post will open the detailed about window. There are many different ways I have organized the content. On the more info popup, each movie has 5 similar or related movies.

I extended the top rated collection by creating a page selection option. There are now 10 pages worth of top rated movies.
I chose to go in my own direction with the UI.

I do want to implement the backend sometime soon!
